🚕 Trip Duration Estimation & Customer Behavior Analysis
Solo Project Submission for Daxwell – Data Analyst Interview

Author: Prasanth Dadala

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes taxi trip data to:

Predict trip duration using machine learning

Identify customer behavior patterns

Perform data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and modeling

Demonstrate strong skills in SQL, Python, visualization, and storytelling

🧰 Tech Stack Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

EDA: Outlier analysis, distributions, correlations

Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, (optional: XGBoost)

SQL: Filtering, grouping, joins, time-based aggregations

Visualization Tools: Power BI (optional)

🧹 1. Data Cleaning

Removed nulls and duplicates

Converted timestamps

Removed impossible coordinates

Calculated trip duration (in minutes)

Engineered features: hour of day, day of week, distance

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualizations include:

Trip duration distribution

Peak hour analysis

Distance vs duration

Correlation heatmap

Insights:

Distance is the strongest predictor of duration

Peak hours show higher trip times due to congestion

Longer trips occur more often on weekdays

🤖 3. Modeling

Models trained:

Model	RMSE	R² Score
Linear Regression	___	___
Random Forest	___	___
XGBoost (optional)	___	___

(Random Forest usually performs best.)

🧠 4. Key Insights

Travel behavior varies significantly by time of day

Short trips dominate but long trips show more variability

ML models effectively estimate ETA for practical use cases
